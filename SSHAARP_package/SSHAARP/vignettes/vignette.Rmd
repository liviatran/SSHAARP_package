# Overview
The Searching Shared HLA Amino Acid Residue Prevalence (SSHAARP) Package processes amino acid alignments produced by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database to identify user-defined amino acid residue motifs shared across HLA alleles, and calculates the frequencies of those motifs based on HLA allele frequency data. SSHAARP uses Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software and the GMT R Package to generate global frequency heat maps that illustrate the distribution of each user-defined map around the globe. SSHAARP analyzes the allele frequency data described in Solberg et al. 2008, a global set of 497 population samples from 185 published datasets, representing 66,800 individuals.

Future plans for SSHAARP include producing heat maps based on allelic frequencies obtained from the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND). 

SSHAARP obtains HLA amino acid alignments from the IPD-IMGT/HLA GitHub repository at: https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA/tree/Latest/alignments.

The required Solberg dataset (See: doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2008.05.001) file is the 1-locus-alleles.dat file in the results.zip archive at http://pypop.org/popdata/. Columns of the Solberg dataset that are pertinent to this package, along with an explanation of their contents, are as follows: 
  
  **popname** - contains the population name, followed by a year, indicating the year of publication of the literature the population information was derived from

  **contin** - contains three letter abbreviations of 10 major world regions:
  
        AUS - Australia
        EUR - Europe
        NAF - north Africa
        NAM - North America
        NEA - northeast Asia
        OCE - Oceania
        SAM - South America
        SEA - southeast Asia
        SSA - sub-Saharan Africa
        SWA - southwest Asia

  Significantly admixed populations were placed in an **'OTH'**, or other, group
    
    
  **complex** - assigns level of complexity, ranging from 1 (least complex) to 3 (most complex), which estimates the degree of potential admixture in a population sample. Complexity values suffixed with 'mig' indicate migrant populations.
    
  **latit** - latitude coordinates of the population.
    
  **longit** - longitude coordinates of the population.
    
  **locus** - HLA locus information of collected data.
    
  **allele_v3** - IPD-IMGT/HLA Database version 3_*_* allele names.
    
  **allele.freq** - frequency of the corresponding HLA allele for a population.       

***

SSHAARP's functions interact with two external datasets and one R package:

1. IPD-IMGT/HLA:
    
    **countSpaces()** counts the number of whitespaces in the ANHIG alignment files to discern where the alignment start is.
    
    **BLAASD()** extracts alignment sequence information for a given locus from the ANHIG/IMGTHLA Github repository to produce a dataframe of amino acid sequence data for each individual peptide position for all alleles.
    
      **findMotif** isolates the individual amino acid position dataframe produced by BLAASD() to only alleles with the user-defined motif. 
      
2. Solberg Dataset:

      **convertCoordinates()** converts coordinates in the Solberg dataset with cardinal directions to their appropriate enumerations (i.e. 50S is converted to -50)
  
      **dataSubset()** manipulates the Solberg dataset by adding in a new column containing locus*allele information, reordering the dataset based on population name, and subsetting the data to only the locus of interest.
  
3. Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

      **PALM()** applies the Generic Mapping Tools (gmt) R package to the modified Solberg data to produce heatmaps. The gmt R package is an interface between R and the GMT Map-Making software, and is required for the PALM()() function. GMT commands are called via a Bash script through using the gmt.system() function in the GMT R package. Both the gmt R package **AND** GMT software must be installed to run SSHAARP, which is available here: https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/.

## Functions

### BLAASD()
BLAASD() extracts alignment sequence information for a given locus from the ANHIG/IMGTHLA Github Repository to produce a dataframe, which contains individual amino acid data for each amino acid position for all alleles, for a user-defined HLA locus or loci. The first 4 columns are locus, allele, trimmed allele, and allele_name and are shown as an example below.

Example output of BLAASD() for HLA-A, where the selected row outputs are 2 and 8 to illustrate different HLA-A alleles, and selected columns are the first 19 columns of the dataframe, where the first 4 columns consist of the locus, allele, trimmed_allele of 2 fields, and the full allele name. The rest of the columns consist of corresponding amino acids for each amino acid position for a given allele. 

```
>BLAASD("A")[[1]][c(2,8),1:19]
  locus       allele trimmed_allele    allele_name -24 -23 -22 -21 -20 -19 -18 -17 -16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10

```

### findMotif()
findMotif() parses up the provided amino-acid motif, and should be written as `locus*##$~##$~##$`, where ## identifies a peptide position, and $ identifies an amino acid residue. Motifs can include any number of amino acids positions. The following output is an example of the 1st, 5th, and 9th DRB1 alleles that have the `DRB1*26F~28E~30Y` motif. 

```
>findMotif("DRB1*26F~28E~30Y")[c(1,5,9,10), 1:65]

```

If a motif is not found, a dataframe with the motif in one column and an error message in another column is output.

```
>findMotif("DRB1*26F~28E~30Z")

             Motif               Error.message
1 DRB1*26F~28E~30Z No alleles match this motif
```

### dataSubset()
dataSubset() manipulates the Solberg dataset to prepare for heatmap generation by adding in a new column containing locus*allele information, reordering the dataset based on population name, and subsetting the dataset to only the locus of interest.

### convertCoordinates()
convertCoordinates() converts coordinates in the Solberg dataset with a cardinal direction to its appropriate numerical enumeration for plotting on a map. North (N), which is above the equator, and East (E), which is east of the prime meridian are positive, while South (S), below the equator, and West (W), west of the prime meridian, are negative.

```

### countSpaces()
countSpaces() splits a given string, and white spaces are counted in between split elements. This function was used to count whitespaces in the alignment data downloaded from the ANHIG Github repository to determine the starting amino acid position. See below:

```
Prot              -30                              1
                   |                                |
 A*01:01:01:01           MAVM APRTLLLLLS GALALTQTWA GSHSMRYFFT SVSRPGRGEP RFIAVGYVDD 
 A*01:01:01:02N          ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
 A*01:01:01:03           ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
 A*01:01:01:04           ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
 A*01:01:01:05           ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
 A*01:01:01:06           ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
```
Alignment files from the ANHIG repository are formatted such that a certain number of characters must be present in a given line to maintain the alignment structure, so the start position is not immediately provided in the file. To avoid hard coding a start position, countSpaces() was used to calculate the number of spaces between the pipe, which is right underneath the starting count (-30). In order to accomplish this, the following items were needed: 
  1)the number of spaces between the word "Prot" and starting count, "-30",
  2)the number of spaces from the end of the first allele name to the beginning of the amino acid start position
  3)the number of characters in the first allele
  where the number of spaces between -30 and the beginning of the first amino acid were calculated by adding item 3 with item 2, and subtracting the sum of that from item 1.
  
 ``` 
#number of whitespaces counted for row 3 in the alignment file 
>countSpaces(alignment[[1]][3])
 [1]  1 11  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
 ``` 

### PALM() 

PALM() produces a heatmap from the manipulated Solberg dataset by using the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) R Package, which is an interface between R and the GMT Map-Making software. GMT software is required for this function and can be downloaded at https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/. GMT commands are called via a Bash script through using the gmt.system() function in the GMT R package. The final output of PALM() is a heatmap saved as a JPEG in the user's working directory. 

Two default parameters are set for PALM():
  1) color = TRUE
  Should the heatmap produced be in color? The default for color is set to true for a color heatmap – for a map in grayscale, set color==FALSE.
  2) filter_migrant = TRUE
  Should OTH and migrant populations be filtered out of the dataset? The default for filter_migrant is set to true – set this parameter equal to FALSE to keep migrant and OTH populations in the dataset.

```
#JPEG with color
>PALM(Solberg_datset, "DRB1*26F~28E~30Y" )
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}
knitr::include_graphics("basemap_color.jpg")
```
  
```
#JPEG without color
>PALM(Solberg_datset, "DRB1*26F~28E~30Y", color=FALSE)
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}
knitr::include_graphics("basemap_bw.jpg")
```
